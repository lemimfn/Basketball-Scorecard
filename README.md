# Basketball-Scorecard
A simple basketball scorecard web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to track and update scores for two teams with interactive buttons and a clean UI. It was created to practice core front-end concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and layout styling.
